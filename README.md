# Banker's Algorithm Simulator

This project is a web-based simulation of the **Banker's Algorithm**, which is commonly used in operating systems to manage resource allocation and avoid deadlocks. The tool allows users to input the number of processes and resources, simulating the system's behavior to determine whether a safe sequence exists or if the system is in an unsafe state.

## Features

- Input number of processes and resources.
- Input resource allocation and maximum resource demand for each process.
- Calculates and displays a **safe sequence** if available.
- Detects and notifies if the system is in an **unsafe state**.
- Displays the **Need Matrix** for each process.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs the number of processes and resources.
2. The system generates fields to input:
   - **Resource Allocation**: Resources currently allocated to each process.
   - **Maximum Demand**: Maximum resources each process may need.
   - **Available Resources**: Resources currently available in the system.
3. The algorithm calculates:
   - **Need Matrix**: The remaining resources each process requires to complete its execution.
   - **Safe Sequence**: Determines if the system can safely allocate resources to each process without causing a deadlock.
4. If the system is in a safe state, the safe sequence is displayed. Otherwise, an unsafe state warning is shown.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** and **JavaScript** for frontend functionality.
- **Bootstrap** for styling and layout.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bankers-algorithm-simulator.git
   ```
2. Open the `OS_Project.html` file in a web browser.
## Future Enhancements

- Add input validation for user data.
- Display step-by-step progress of the algorithm.
- Implement additional algorithms for comparison (e.g., Deadlock Detection Algorithm).
